# Algorithms

This project contains implementations of the following:
* An algorithm to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem
* An algorithm to solve the N-Queens problem
* An algorithm to generate all the subgroups of a given set
* An algorithm to generate all the permutations of a given set

These are just sample implementations, for practice. Probably can be improved, fixes welcome :)
